        <p> Words alone cannot express what you mean to me in times of pain in times of stress you will always be there. </p>
        
        <p> Whenever I wanted to play and have fun you always had the time to spare and played till we were done </p>
        
        <p> Sometimes you'd even let me win oh the smile on my face </p>
        
        <p> For all the things you've done for me, and all the times you cared </p>
